## Finance Settlement Report Dashboard

This project enhances accuracy and efficiency in financial reconciliation by transforming raw transaction data into an optimized BI solution.  It empowers finance teams to validate settlements, match aggregated figures with raw data, and seamlessly download reports via Google Cloud Storage.

**Key Features and Contributions:**

* **Crucial Raw Data for Reconciliation:**
    * Integrated scattered datasetsâ€”transaction records, payment logs, shipping fees, and platform deductionsâ€”into a structured datamart.
    * Reduced manual effort, ensured data accuracy, and provided finance teams with a final dataset tailored for reconciliation and revenue validation.
* **Accurate Aggregation Matching Raw Data:**
    * Designed a monitoring dashboard to track the number of raw records inserted into each datamart.
    * Ensured every transaction processed aligns with the aggregated totals in the final reports.
    * Enabled early detection of anomalies, prevented revenue misallocation, and ensured compliance with financial audits.
* **Automated CSV Download via Google Cloud Storage:**
    * Maintained and troubleshooted the data pipeline, including identifying errors and backfilling missing data.
    * Ensured finance teams receive complete reports.
    * Enabled finance teams to seamlessly download structured reports for audits, analysis, and system integration from Google Cloud Storage.
    * Reduced manual workload and improved efficiency.
* **Additional Features & Impact:**
    * **Multi-Level Filtering & Drilldowns:** Users can segment financial data by platform, payment type, or region for deep-dive analysis.
    * **Real-Time Data Processing:** Google Cloud Functions and BigQuery ensure near-instant data availability, minimizing reporting delays.
    * **Operational Cost Savings:** Shifted data processing from the main system to BI dashboards, significantly cutting costs associated with raw data extraction.

**Overall Impact:**

By integrating structured financial data, automated reporting, and scalable reconciliation tools, this Finance Settlement Report dashboard has become an essential asset for finance teamsâ€”improving efficiency, ensuring accuracy, and optimizing operational costs. ðŸš€
